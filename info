This project runs in Tomcat as well as JBoss 7.1.1. but shows status 404 in glassfish.
There is some configuration needs to be checked for glassfish.


When x.war file is created and installed via maven, packaged war file can be deployed
separately and works well.
Restful urls have been made using spring and Hibernate.
Hibernate.cfg.xml, Entity Bean and spring controller have been used.


JQuerry library and other javascript function have been put under resources in WebContent
and mapped resources in spring-servlet.xml. JSTL Tag lib have been used to get those sources
as used in TryJs.jsp.

While mapping the controller "/" is optional while mapping class ie. RequestMapping("start")
or RequestMapping("/start"). Both work. Same things apply before any method.


While doing @Autowired annotation as used in spring.mvc3 package, 
<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"/> should be used
or <context:annotation-config /> should be used.
Give much importance to the namespace definition, ok.
Copy of DWPMaven is also made.
